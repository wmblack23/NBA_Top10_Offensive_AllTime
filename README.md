# NBA_Top10_Offensive_AllTime

This notebook examines the **Top 10 Offensive Contributors in NBA History**.

In this case, "Offensive Contribution" was calculated by simply adding Points + Assists.  While there are other offensive metrics that matter (FG%, turnover rate, offensive rebounding rate, etc.) PTS & AST are the gold-standard of offensive contribution.  Usually, elite players can either be labeled a scorer (Allen Iverson) or a great passer (Chris Paul) - but the truly great ones did both at the highest level.  That is what this program looks to find.

As a note - I didn't set about exploring this subject initially as a tribute to LeBron James - but as you will see that is more or less what it turned into.  LeBron, already with the most points + assists in NBA history, is of course still right in the middle of his career.  If and when LeBron ever hangs up his sneakers, the gulf between him and the rest will be immense.

This piqued my interest to the question "Will anybody ever catch LeBron?"  The last few graphs are my answer to that.  I graphed his totals against the totals of the current stars of today and then the young stars of today, to see if any of them were on a similar trajectory to The King.

Thanks for checking it out!
